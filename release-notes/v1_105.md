## Chat

### Improved edit tools for bring-your-own-key models

We've improved the set of edit tools given to Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) custom models. We've improved our default tools and added a 'learning' mechanism to select the optimal toolset for custom models. You can also explicitly configure the edits tools given to OpenAI-compatible models in the setting `setting(github.copilot.chat.customOAIModels)`.

### Keep or undo changes during an agent loop

You can now "Keep" and "Undo" changes to files while an edit loop is happening.

### Support for coverage in the `runTests` chat tool

The test running tool provided to chat can now report coverage to the agent. This allows the agent to generate and verify tests that cover the entirety of your code. Ensure that you have the appropriate [testing extension](/docs/debugtest/testing) installed in order to enable the `runTests` tool.

## MCP

### Autostart on by default

In this release we've enabled the setting `setting(chat.mcp.autostart)` by default so that new or outdated MCP servers are started automatically when you send a chat message. We will also now avoid triggering interactions, such as dialogs, when autostarting a server, and instead add an indicator in chat:

![](./images/1_105/mcp_autostart_prompt.png)

### Improved Represention of MCP resources returned from tools

Previously, our implementation of tool results containing resources left it up to the model to retrieve those resources without clear instructions on how to do so. In this version of VS Code, we include a preview of the resource content by default and add instructions to retrieve the complete contents. This should lead to better model performance when using such tools.

### Lazier activation of MCP extensions and `when` clause

We MCP autostart on by default, we no longer eagerly activate extensions and instead will only active MCP-providing extensions when the first chat message is sent. We have also added support for the `when` clause on `mcpServerDefinitionProviders` contribution point, so you can avoid activation when it's not relevant.

### Support for `icons` in servers, resources, and tools

VS Code has adopted [SEP-973](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/955) which allows MCP servers to specify `icons` to associate with their data. This can be used to give a custom icon to servers, resources, and tools.

![](./images/1_105/mcp_icons.png)

HTTP MCP servers must provide icons from the same authority that the MCP server itself is listening on, while stdio servers are allowed to reference `file:///` URIs on disk.

### Support for `default` values in elictation

VS Code has adopted [SEP-1034](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1035) which allows MCP servers to provide `default` values when using elicitation.


## Accessibility


## Editor Experience

### Quick Input allows overriding default keybindings

The Quick Input (Quick Pick, Input Box, etc) like the one used in the Command Palette use to hard code keybindings for navigation like moving up/down the list, accepting (aka ENTER), and a few other interactions. These are now moved to Commands allowing them to be overriden. For example, if you want `TAB` to be used to accept something in the quick pick, this is now possible. To see all keybindings that you can override, open the Keyboard Shortcuts `(kb(workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindings))` and search for `quickInput.`

## Authentication

### macOS Native Broker support for Microsoft Authentication

This milestone, we have adopted the latest MSAL libraries and with that you are now able to sign in through a native experience on macOS (in addition to Windows):

![native broker native dialog](images/1_105/macOS-auth-broker.png)

This experience is only available for:
* M-series (aka ARM) macOS devices
* macOS machines that are intune enrolled with the policy to go through the broker

This enables nice single sign on flows and is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. The MSAL team will be lighting this up for the missing platforms (Linux, Windows ARM, macOS Intel/x64) over time so stay tuned!

> NOTE: If you have trouble authenticating via the broker, you can change the `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` to `msal-no-broker` which will use your browser to authenticate instead.

### PKCE support for GitHub Authentication

[GitHub recently enabled](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-14-pkce-support-for-oauth-and-github-app-authentication/) PKCE ([Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636)) support in their authentication flows. We've have adopted this in the flow that VS Code uses to authenticate to GitHub.

## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_105.md).


## Contributions to extensions


## Extension Authoring

### Microsoft Authentication now supports WWW-Authenticate claims challenges

Azure [is now enforcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication) that all create/delete operations to Azure resources must be done using authenticated sessions that used MFA to sign in. While some organizations require MFA for any authentication reason, some organizations do not enforce this, and those are affected by this MFA enforcement.

If you have an extension that uses Microsoft Authentication and talks to ARM, you will need to handle the case when the ARM API call returns a `401 Unauthorized` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header like so:
```
Bearer realm="", authorization_uri="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize", error="insufficient_claims", claims="SOME VALUE HERE"
```

The good news is that we have introduced finalized API that you can use to handle this status code with ease:

```ts
const wwwAuthenticateFromRequest = headers['WWW-Authenticate']; // the string above
vscode.authentication.getSession(
  'microsoft',
  {
    wwwAuthenticate: wwwAuthenticateFromRequest,
    fallbackScopes: scopesFromOriginalRequest
  },
  {
    createIfNone: true
  })
```

All you have to do is pass in, verbatim, that `WWW-Authenticate` value along with the scopes that you originally asked for (The ARM scope most likely), and the Microsoft Authentication Provider will handle the rest and make sure the user goes through MFA.

We have worked with the Azure Tools team, who own the Azure Resources extension, to adopted this new API so if you are using that extension or something that uses that extension, this enforcement should be handled. If you experience issues, please open them on the [Azure Resources extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azureresourcegroups).

> NOTE: Looking to support `WWW-Authenticate` challenges in _your_ `AuthenticationProvider`? Provide your thoughts on the proposed API in issue [#267992](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/267992).

### List keys in SecretStorage

This iteration we have finalized the API to list all keys that your extension has stored in Secret Storage. This can be found in the `context.secrets` object:
```ts
export function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {
  const const keys: string[] = await context.secrets.keys();

  const value = await context.secrets.get(keys[0]); // a value that exists
}
```
One example where this can be used is on `deactivate`, where you may want to delete all secret storage data.

## Proposed APIs


## Engineering

### Playwright VS Code MCP Server exploration updates

This iteration we explored further this idea to use an MCP server that can control a local build of VS Code to help in the development loop for VS Code. While we received mixed results on model comprehension around parsing screenshots, orchestration for subagents leveraging the `#executePrompt` tool (which can be enabled with `setting(github.copilot.chat.executePrompt.enabled)`) was very effective at not poluting context.

We have more to explore in the future so stay tuned!

In case you want to try this MCP Server out you can find it [in the test/mcp folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/test/mcp) of the vscode repo. It's very easy to get started:

1. Follow the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) for getting a local version of Code OSS running
2. Then you can use [our trivial (for now) prompt file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/cd7de11f65cd5ff6a491f04fc013e363780bde31/.github/prompts/playwright.prompt.md) to ask a question `/playwright your question here` in Agent mode.

## Notable fixes

* [vscode#265842](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/265842) - Chat: fix a file corruption issue affecting Sonnet, Gemini, and Grok models
