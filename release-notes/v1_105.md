## Chat

### Improved edit tools for bring-your-own-key models

We've improved the set of edit tools given to Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) custom models. We've improved our default tools and added a 'learning' mechanism to select the optimal toolset for custom models. You can also explicitly configure the edits tools given to OpenAI-compatible models in the setting `setting(github.copilot.chat.customOAIModels)`.

### Keep or undo changes during an agent loop

You can now "Keep" and "Undo" changes to files while an edit loop is happening.

### Support for coverage in the `runTests` chat tool

The test running tool provided to chat can now report coverage to the agent. This allows the agent to generate and verify tests that cover the entirety of your code. Ensure that you have the appropriate [testing extension](/docs/debugtest/testing) installed in order to enable the `runTests` tool.

## MCP

### Autostart on by default

In this release we've enabled the setting `setting(chat.mcp.autostart)` by default so that new or outdated MCP servers are started automatically when you send a chat message. We will also now avoid triggering interactions, such as dialogs, when autostarting a server, and instead add an indicator in chat:

![](./images/1_105/mcp_autostart_prompt.png)

### Improved Represention of MCP resources returned from tools

Previously, our implementation of tool results containing resources left it up to the model to retrieve those resources without clear instructions on how to do so. In this version of VS Code, we include a preview of the resource content by default and add instructions to retrieve the complete contents. This should lead to better model performance when using such tools.

### Lazier activation of MCP extensions and `when` clause

We MCP autostart on by default, we no longer eagerly activate extensions and instead will only active MCP-providing extensions when the first chat message is sent. We have also added support for the `when` clause on `mcpServerDefinitionProviders` contribution point, so you can avoid activation when it's not relevant.

### Support for `icons` in servers, resources, and tools

VS Code has adopted [SEP-973](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/955) which allows MCP servers to specify `icons` to associate with their data. This can be used to give a custom icon to servers, resources, and tools.

![](./images/1_105/mcp_icons.png)

HTTP MCP servers must provide icons from the same authority that the MCP server itself is listening on, while stdio servers are allowed to reference `file:///` URIs on disk.

### Support for `default` values in elictation

VS Code has adopted [SEP-1034](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1035) which allows MCP servers to provide `default` values when using elicitation.

## Authentication

### macOS Native Broker support for Microsoft Authentication

This milestone, we have adopted the latest MSAL libraries and with that you are now able to sign in through a native experience on macOS (in addition to Windows):

![native broker native dialog](images/1_105/macOS-auth-broker.png)

This experience is only available for:
* M-series (aka ARM) macOS devices
* macOS machines that are intune enrolled with the policy to go through the broker

This enables nice single sign on flows and is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. The MSAL team will be lighting this up for the missing platforms (Linux, Windows ARM, macOS Intel/x64) over time so stay tuned!

> NOTE: If you have trouble authenticating via the broker, you can change the `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` to `msal-no-broker` which will use your browser to authenticate instead.

### PKCE support for GitHub Authentication

[GitHub recently enabled](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-14-pkce-support-for-oauth-and-github-app-authentication/) PKCE ([Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636)) support in their authentication flows. We've have adopted this in the flow that VS Code uses to authenticate to GitHub.

## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_105.md).


## Contributions to extensions


## Extension Authoring

### List keys in SecretStorage

This iteration we have finalized the API to list all keys that your extension has stored in Secret Storage. This can be found in the `context.secrets` object:
```ts
export function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {
  const const keys: string[] = await context.secrets.keys();

  const value = await context.secrets.get(keys[0]); // a value that exists
}
```
One example where this can be used is on `deactivate`, where you may want to delete all secret storage data.
