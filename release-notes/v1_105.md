## Chat

### OS notifications for chat responses

**Setting**: `setting(chat.notifyWindowOnResponseReceived)`

In VS Code 1.103, we introduced OS notifications for chat sessions that required a user confirmation when the VS Code window was not focused. In this release, we are expanding this functionality to show an OS badge and notification toast when a chat response is received. The notification includes a preview of the response, and selecting it brings focus to the chat input.

![An OS notification displays text while the VS Code window is unfocused: create a new file named candy with a f... I can add that, but I need to know what kind of file you want—should candy be a TypeScript file (can...](images/1_105/chat-notification.png)

You can control the notification behavior with the `setting(chat.notifyWindowOnResponseReceived)` setting.

### Fully qualified tool names

Prompt files and custom chat modes enable you to specify which tools can be used. To avoid naming conflicts between built-in tools and tools provided by MCP servers or extensions, we now support fully qualified tool names for prompt files and chat modes. This also helps with discovering missing extensions or MCP servers.

Tool names are now qualified by the MCP server, extension, or tool set they are part of. For example, instead of `codebase`, you would use `search/codebase` or `list_issues` would be `github/github-mcp-server/list_issues`.

You can still use the previous notation, however a code actions helps migrating to the new names.

![alt text](images/1_105/qualified_tool_names.png)

### Keep or undo changes during an agent loop

Previously, when an agent was still processing your chat request, you could not keep or undo file edits until the agent finished. Now, you can keep or undo changes to files while an edit loop is happening. This enables you to have more control, especially for long-running tasks.

### Show recent chat sessions (Experimental)

**Setting**: `setting(chat.emptyState.history.enabled)`

To quickly pick up where you left off or revisit some past conversations after starting a new chat session, you can now see your recent local chat conversations when the Chat view is empty.

![Screenshot of the Chat view showing recent local chat conversations when there are no active chat sessions.](images/1_105/chat-history-on-empty.png)

By default, this functionality is off, but you can enable it with the `setting(chat.emptyState.history.enabled)` setting.

### Keyboard shortcuts for navigating user chat messages

We have added Keyboard shortcut for navigating previous/next user chat items (i.e. user prompts) in Chat sidebar. Keybindings are as follows:

* Navigate previous:  `kb(workbench.action.chat.previousUserPrompt)`
* Navigate next:  `kb(workbench.action.chat.nextUserPrompt)`

### Run tests with code coverage

If you have a testing extension installed for your code, the `runTests` agent tool enables the agent to run tests in your codebase by using the [VS Code testing integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/testing) rather than running them from the command line.

In this release, the `runTests` tool now also reports test code coverage to the agent. This enables the agent to generate and verify tests that cover the entirety of your code.

### Chat Sessions view improvements

**Setting**: `setting(chat.agentSessionsViewLocation)`

The **Chat Sessions** view provides a centralized location for managing both local chat conversations and remote coding agent sessions. This view enables you to work with multiple AI sessions simultaneously, track their progress, and manage long-running tasks efficiently. In this release, we've made several UI refinements and performance improvements to enhance the Chat Sessions experience.

The Chat Sessions view continues to support features like status bar tracking for monitoring multiple coding agents, context menus for session management, and rich descriptions to provide detailed context for each session.

Quickly initiate a new session using the "+" button in the view header.

![Chat Sessions view with a new session open via the + button](images/1_105/chat-sessions.png)

### Delegate to coding agent button visible by default

The **Delegate to coding agent** button in the Chat view will now appear by default to users working in repositories that have [Copilot coding agent enabled](https://aka.ms/coding-agent-docs). _Delegating_ in chat allows you to seamlessly transition context from a local chat conversation to a GitHub coding agent session, where the agent works on your task in the background and creates a pull request with the solution.

#### Summarization enhancements

When you use the delegate action, all the context from your chat conversation, including file references, are forwarded to the coding agent.  If your conversation exceeds the coding agent's context window, VS Code will automatically summarize and condense the information to fit. This enables you to have a detailed planning conversation in the Chat view before handing off the implementation work to the agent, ensuring it has all the necessary context to complete the task effectively.

### Chain of thought (Experimental)

**Setting**: `setting(chat.agent.thinkingStyle)`

With the introduction of GPT-5-Codex, thinking tokens are now shown in chat. Chain of thought will show the model’s reasoning as it responds, which can great for debugging or understanding suggestions the model provides.

There are a few ways to display or hide chain of thought that can be configurable with the setting below. Thinking tokens will soon be available in more models as well!

### Improved edit tools for bring-your-own-key models

**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.customOAIModels)`

We've improved the set of edit tools given to Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) custom models. We've improved our default tools and added a 'learning' mechanism to select the optimal toolset for custom models.

For OpenAI-compatible models, you can also explicitly configure the list of edit tools with the setting `setting(github.copilot.chat.customOAIModels)`.

### Terminal commands

#### Experimental auto-reply to prompts

**Setting**: `setting(chat.tools.terminal.autoReplyToPrompts)`

We've introduced an opt-in setting, `chat.tools.terminal.autoReplyToPrompts`, which allows the agent to respond to prompts for input in the terminal automatically.

#### Free form input request detection

When the terminal requires free-form input, we now display a confirmation prompt. This lets you stay focused on your current work and only shift attention when input is actually needed.

## MCP

### Autostart on by default

In this release we've enabled the setting `setting(chat.mcp.autostart)` by default so that new or outdated MCP servers are started automatically when you send a chat message. We will also now avoid triggering interactions, such as dialogs, when autostarting a server, and instead add an indicator in chat:

![](./images/1_105/mcp_autostart_prompt.png)

### Improved Representation of MCP resources returned from tools

Previously, our implementation of tool results containing resources left it up to the model to retrieve those resources without clear instructions on how to do so. In this version of VS Code, we include a preview of the resource content by default and add instructions to retrieve the complete contents. This should lead to better model performance when using such tools.

### Lazier activation of MCP extensions and `when` clause

We MCP autostart on by default, we no longer eagerly activate extensions and instead will only active MCP-providing extensions when the first chat message is sent. We have also added support for the `when` clause on `mcpServerDefinitionProviders` contribution point, so you can avoid activation when it's not relevant.

### Support for `icons` in servers, resources, and tools

VS Code has adopted [SEP-973](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/955) which allows MCP servers to specify `icons` to associate with their data. This can be used to give a custom icon to servers, resources, and tools.

![](./images/1_105/mcp_icons.png)

HTTP MCP servers must provide icons from the same authority that the MCP server itself is listening on, while stdio servers are allowed to reference `file:///` URIs on disk.

### Support for `default` values in elicitation

VS Code has adopted [SEP-1034](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1035) which allows MCP servers to provide `default` values when using elicitation.


## Accessibility

### Shell integration for pwsh on Windows support for screen readers

PSReadLine has historically been disabled when a screen reader is detected, to avoid overwhelming users with excessive auditory feedback. Since our terminal’s shell integration relies on PSReadLine support, we now activate a streamlined version of PSReadLine in screen reader mode. This ensures shell integration and its features work for screen reader users.

### Chat improvements

**Setting**: `setting(accessibility.verboseChatProgressUpdates)`

A new setting, `setting(accessibility.verboseChatProgressUpdates)`, enables more detailed announcements for screen reader users about chat activity.

From the chat input, users can focus the last focused chat response item `kb(workbench.chat.action.focusLastFocused)`.

### Accessible view persistence

When switching between VS Code and other windows, we now maintain the user's position in the accessible view for a seamless workflow.

## Editor Experience

### Quick Input allows overriding default keybindings

The Quick Input (Quick Pick, Input Box, etc) like the one used in the Command Palette use to hard code keybindings for navigation like moving up/down the list, accepting (`kbstyle(Enter)`), and a few other interactions.

These are now moved to Commands allowing them to be overriden. For example, if you want `kbstyle(Tab)` to be used to accept something in the Quick Pick, this is now possible. To see all keybindings that you can override, open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor `(kb(workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindings))` and search for `quickInput.`

## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Resolve merge conflict with AI

When opening a file with git merge conflict markers, users will be able to resolve merge conflicts with AI using a new action that we have added to the lower right hand corner of the editor. Clicking on the new action, will open the Chat panel and start an agentic flow with the merge base, and changes from each branch as context.

### Add history item change to chat context

Couple of milestones ago we have added the capability to view the files in each history item shown in the Source Control Graph view. You can now add a file from a history item as context to a chat request. This can be useful when you want to provide the contents of a specific version of a file as context for your chat prompt. To add a file from a history item to chat, click on a history item to view the list of files, right click on a particular file and then select **Add to Chat** from the context menu.

## Debugging

## Testing

### Swap test result column

You can change the side on which the result tree is displayed in the Test Results view by using the new swap ↔️ button in the view's title menu.

## Tasks

### OS notification for long-running task completion

**Setting**: `setting(task.notifyWindowOnTaskCompletion)`

When a user-initiated, long-running task completes while the VS Code window is not focused, an OS badge and notification toast are shown. Selecting the notification focuses the window where the task completed. You can configure this behavior with the `setting(task.notifyWindowOnTaskCompletion)` setting.

![An OS notification shows Task "build" completed in 1 minute 21 seconds](images/1_105/task-notification.png)

### Task terminal title persistence

**Setting**: `setting(terminal.integrated.tabs.title)`

With the default `setting(terminal.integrated.tabs.title)` value of `${process}`, a task terminal's name would change when the process did. For tasks, this could cause confusion. Now, we persist the task's name.

## Terminal

### Start dictation exposed

We have added the **Start dictation** action to the terminal overflow menu. The **Stop dictation** action will also appear when relevant.

![Terminal overflow menu in Visual Studio Code showing options such as Scroll to Previous Command, Scroll to Next Command, Clear Terminal, Run Active File, Run Selected Text, Go to Recent Directory, Run Recent Command, and Start Dictation in Terminal.](images/1_105/start-dictation-terminal.png)

## Authentication

### macOS Native Broker support for Microsoft Authentication

**Setting**: `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)`

This milestone, we have adopted the latest MSAL libraries and with that you are now able to sign in through a native experience on macOS (in addition to Windows):

![native broker native dialog](images/1_105/macOS-auth-broker.png)

This experience is only available for:

* M-series (aka ARM) macOS devices
* macOS machines that are Intune enrolled with the policy to go through the broker

This enables nice single sign on flows and is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. The MSAL team will be lighting this up for the missing platforms (Linux, Windows ARM, macOS Intel/x64) over time so stay tuned!

> NOTE: If you have trouble authenticating via the broker, you can change the `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` to `msal-no-broker` which will use your browser to authenticate instead.

### PKCE support for GitHub Authentication

[GitHub recently enabled](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-14-pkce-support-for-oauth-and-github-app-authentication/) PKCE ([Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636)) support in their authentication flows. We've have adopted this in the flow that VS Code uses to authenticate to GitHub.

## Languages

### Python

#### Copy Test ID from editor gutter

The run gutter icon context menu now includes a **Copy Test ID** command to quickly copy the fully qualified pytest or unittest test identifier.

![](./images/1_105/py_copy_test_id.mp4)

## Contributions to extensions


## Extension Authoring

### Microsoft Authentication now supports WWW-Authenticate claims challenges

[Azure is now enforcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication) that all create/delete operations to Azure resources must be done using authenticated sessions that used MFA to sign in. While some organizations require MFA for any authentication reason, some organizations do not enforce this, and those are affected by this MFA enforcement.

If you have an extension that uses Microsoft Authentication and talks to ARM, you need to handle the case when the ARM API call returns a `401 Unauthorized` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header like so:

```text
Bearer realm="", authorization_uri="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize", error="insufficient_claims", claims="SOME VALUE HERE"
```

The good news is that we have introduced a finalized API that you can use to handle this status code:

```ts
const wwwAuthenticateFromRequest = headers['WWW-Authenticate']; // the string above
vscode.authentication.getSession(
  'microsoft',
  {
    wwwAuthenticate: wwwAuthenticateFromRequest,
    fallbackScopes: scopesFromOriginalRequest
  },
  {
    createIfNone: true
  })
```

All you have to do is pass in, verbatim, that `WWW-Authenticate` value along with the scopes that you originally asked for (most likely the ARM scope), and the Microsoft Authentication Provider handles the rest and makes sure the user goes through MFA.

We have worked with the Azure Tools team, who own the Azure Resources extension, to adopt this new API. If you are using that extension or something that uses that extension, this enforcement should be handled. If you experience issues, please open them on the [Azure Resources extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azureresourcegroups).

> NOTE: Looking to support `WWW-Authenticate` challenges in _your_ `AuthenticationProvider`? Provide your thoughts on the proposed API in issue [#267992](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/267992).

### Prompt and instructions file contributions

Extensions can now contribute prompt and instructions files.

```json
  "contributes": {
    "chatPromptFiles": [
      {
        "name": "ReviewAndCreateIssue",
        "description": "Review the selected code and create an issue",
        "path": "./prompts/reviewAndCreateIssue.prompt.md"
      }
    ],
    "chatInstructions": [
      {
        "name": "TextMateGuidelines",
        "description": "Use these instructions when creating or modifying TextMate grammars",
        "path": "./prompts/textMateGuidelines.instructions.md"
      }
    ]
  }
```

Chat mode contributions (`chatModes`) are currently behind a proposed API flag.

### List keys in SecretStorage

This iteration, we have finalized the API to list all keys that your extension has stored in Secret Storage. This can be found in the `context.secrets` object:

```ts
export function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {
  const const keys: string[] = await context.secrets.keys();

  const value = await context.secrets.get(keys[0]); // a value that exists
}
```

One example where this can be used is on `deactivate`, where you might want to delete all secret storage data.

## Proposed APIs


## Engineering

### Playwright VS Code MCP server

This iteration, we explored further the idea of using an MCP server that can control a local build of VS Code to help in the development loop for VS Code. While we had mixed results on model comprehension for parsing screenshots, orchestration for subagents leveraging the `#executePrompt` tool (which can be enabled with `setting(github.copilot.chat.executePrompt.enabled)`) was very effective at not poluting context.

We have more to explore in the future so stay tuned!

In case you want to try this MCP Server out you can find it [in the test/mcp folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/test/mcp) of the vscode repo. It's very easy to get started:

1. Follow the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) for getting a local version of Code OSS running
2. Use [our trivial (for now) prompt file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/cd7de11f65cd5ff6a491f04fc013e363780bde31/.github/prompts/playwright.prompt.md) in agent mode to ask a question: `/playwright <your question here>`.
